# BhashaMitra Platform

**BhashaMitra** is a usage-first Indian language learning platform.

The platform aims to help learners understand how Indian languages are
*actually spoken and written* — through words, sentences, audio, and
contextual explanations — starting with **Marathi** and expanding to
**Hindi**, **Gujarati**, and other languages.

## What BhashaMitra Focuses On

Instead of treating language as a static dictionary,
BhashaMitra treats language as **living usage**.

The platform emphasizes:
- Real-world usage over abstract definitions
- Spoken and written language distinctions
- High-frequency vocabulary
- Contextual learning through sentences
- Clear explanations for learners

---

## MVP Direction (Phase 1)

The first phase focuses on building a strong **language core**, which includes:

- Word entries (lemmas)
- Common inflections and variants
- Real usage sentences
- Pronunciation audio
- Basic search and navigation

Words are the starting point — not the final form of the product.

---

## Future Directions (Not in MVP)

The platform is intentionally designed to grow into:
- Phrase and sentence libraries
- Guided lessons
- Grammar explanations tied to usage
- Learner progress and practice
- Multiple Indian languages using a shared model

These will be added incrementally.

---

## Architecture (high-level)

- Backend: Java (Spring Boot)
- Database: MySQL
- Frontend: Web
- Audio: Object storage (e.g., S3)

Details will evolve.

---

## Philosophy

- Build a solid language core first
- Optimize for learners, not linguists
- Quality over quantity
- Grow deliberately

---

## Status

🚧 Project initialized — Shri Ganesha phase.

Initial focus: Marathi language core.
